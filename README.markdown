#How to use:
1. Launch iOS Simulator
2. Make sure the simulator's scale (Window | Scale) fits SimFinger. For retina devices, scale @ 50%. For non-retina, just use 100% 
3. Launch SimFinger
  - If you want to build from code, launch the [SimFinger.xcodeproj](https://github.com/jonchui/SimFinger/tree/master/Fake/SimFinger/FakeFinger.xcodeproj)
  - If you want a compiled version, download [SimFingerApp.zip](https://github.com/jonchui/SimFinger/blob/master/SimFingerApp.zip)
